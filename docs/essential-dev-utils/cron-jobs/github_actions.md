- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`: Specifies the environment in which the job runs.
- `container: image: alpine/curl:latest`: Uses an Alpine container image with `curl` installed to perform HTTP requests.
- `steps`: Lists the individual steps that will be executed in the job.
- `- name: Update Slack status using curl`: The name of the step indicating that it updates the Slack status.
- `current_time=$(date +%s)`: Retrieves the current timestamp.
- `expiration_time=$((current_time + 3600))`: Calculates an expiration time for the status that is set to expire in one hour (3600 seconds).
- `curl --silent --output /dev/null -X POST ...`: Sends a POST request to the Slack API to update the userâ€™s profile with the specified status, including status text, emoji, and expiration.
