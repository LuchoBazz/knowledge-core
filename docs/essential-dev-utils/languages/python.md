## Clearing the Pip Cache and Installing a Package in a Virtual Environment

```bash
pip3 cache purge
python3 -m venv cache_venv
source cache_venv/bin/activate
pip install package
```

### Explanation
This set of commands purges the existing cache for pip and installs a Python package in a newly created virtual environment. Below is a detailed breakdown of each command:
- `pip3 cache purge`: Clears all cached packages stored by pip to free up space or ensure a fresh installation of dependencies.
- `python3 -m venv cache_venv`: Creates a new Python virtual environment named `cache_venv` to isolate dependencies for the project.
- `source cache_venv/bin/activate`: Activates the virtual environment, switching the terminal to use the isolated Python and pip versions within the environment.
- `pip install package`: Installs the specified Python package (replace `package` with the actual package name) in the activated virtual environment.

This approach ensures a clean environment for managing Python dependencies, avoiding conflicts with system-wide packages or previously cached versions.
