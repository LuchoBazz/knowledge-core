## Converting PDF to HTML on macOS

To convert a PDF file to HTML format on macOS, it is necessary to install the required tools using Homebrew. The following commands will install `pdftohtml` and its dependencies:

```bash
brew install pdftohtml
brew install poppler
```

### Explanation
This section outlines how to convert a PDF file into HTML format and subsequently generate a PDF from an HTML document. The process utilizes command-line tools and Python libraries to achieve these tasks. 

The conversion from PDF to HTML is accomplished using the `pdftohtml` command, which allows users to preserve image quality, include hidden text, and create a single HTML file without using frames. The Python script checks if the PDF file exists before attempting the conversion and provides appropriate error handling.

### Python Implementation

The following Python code demonstrates how to convert a PDF file to HTML using the `pdftohtml` command-line tool. It includes error handling to ensure that the input file exists before attempting the conversion.

```python
import subprocess
import os

def pdf_to_html(pdf_path, output_html):
    # Check if the PDF file exists
    if not os.path.isfile(pdf_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {pdf_path}")

    # Command to convert PDF to HTML
    command = [
        'pdftohtml',  # Command
        '-c',         # Retain image quality
        '-hidden',    # Include hidden text
        '-s',         # Create a single HTML file
        '-noframes',  # Do not use frames
        pdf_path,     # Input PDF path
        output_html   # Output HTML file path
    ]

    try:
        # Execute the command
        subprocess.run(command, check=True)
        print(f"Conversion completed! HTML saved at: {output_html}")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during the conversion: {e}")

# Example usage
pdf_file = 'input.pdf'          # Change this to the path of your PDF file
output_file = 'output.html'     # Change this to your desired output path

pdf_to_html(pdf_file, output_file)
```
