*A table with English content, Spanish translations, and IPA pronunciation for Spanish speakers.*

```ts title="prompt"
Could you create a table with the following structure [STRUCTURE] containing the following information:

The first column should have the content in English, the second column should have the content in Spanish (translate if necessary), and the third column should contain the IPA pronunciation for a Spanish speaker.
Give me just the table without any additional text

[STRUCTURE] = [STRUCTURE_HERE]
[CONTENT] = [CONTENT_HERE]
```
