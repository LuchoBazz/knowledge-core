## Generate WhatsApp Link with Country Code

To create a WhatsApp message link for a specific phone number, use the following format:

```
https://wa.me/57320XXXXXXX
```

Replace `57320XXXXXXX` with the full phone number, including the country code, but omit the "+" symbol. 

### Explanation
This link format allows you to generate a direct chat link for a specific number on WhatsApp. Here’s a breakdown of how to format the link:
- `https://wa.me/`: The base URL for WhatsApp’s direct messaging feature.
- `57`: The country code, in this case for Colombia.
- `320XXXXXXX`: The local phone number, following the country code.

### Example
For a Colombian phone number `320XXXXXXX`, with the country code `+57`, you should use:

https://wa.me/57320XXXXXXX

Clicking this link will open a chat with the specified number on WhatsApp, provided that the user has WhatsApp installed on their device.
