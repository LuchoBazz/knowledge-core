## Generate Telegram Link with Country Code

To create a Telegram message link for a specific phone number or username, use the following formats:

```
https://t.me/+57320XXXXXXX
```
or  
```
https://t.me/username  
```

Replace `57320XXXXXXX` with the full phone number, including the country code, or replace username with the actual Telegram username.

### Explanation
These link formats allow you to generate a direct chat link for a specific number or username on Telegram. Here’s a breakdown of how to format the link:
- `https://t.me/`: The base URL for Telegram’s direct messaging feature.
- `+57`: The country code, in this case for Colombia.
- `320XXXXXXX`: The local phone number, following the country code.
- `username`: The unique Telegram username for a user or group.

### Example
For a Colombian phone number `320XXXXXXX`, with the country code `+57`, you should use:

```
https://t.me/+57320XXXXXXX
```

For a user with the Telegram username john_doe, the link would be:

```
https://t.me/john_doe
```

Clicking these links will open a chat with the specified phone number or user on Telegram, provided that the user has Telegram installed on their device.
